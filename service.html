     SERVICE OPERATIONS

    <p>

        Every fast food restaurant is operating whether as a corporation or private business is purposed at generating a new upsurge in service operations; all aimed towards implementing and supporting the brand quality (Brown et al., 2013). As one of the leading and the most prosperous fast food restaurant in the world, McDonald's has numerous service operations (Appendix 4). At the moment, McDonald's is adopting the service operations aimed to generate outstanding experiences for its customers by product, place, price, promotion and people.

        PRODUCT 
    </h2>
<p>
    The product is the physical product or service provided by the company to the customers. It encompasses both the tangible and the non-tangible aspects such as appearances, assurance or packaging. McDonald's offers products in the same packages in diverse countries, and the consistency of these products attract many loyal customers (Singla, 2012). In the UK, the company has studied the behaviour of customers and provide an entirely different menu as compared to other countries. As such, McDonald's has been able to constantly innovate its products based on the changing tastes and preferences of its customers. The company introduce new products with a reputed brand, high-quality and outstanding customer-related features (Mcdonalds, 2017).

It is worth mentioning that McDonald's has made a series of the strict menu to maintain the distinctive freshness and taste of its product. During manufacturing, the product undergoes many quality checks to make sure it achieves the high-quality aspect (Appendix 2). For example, the hamburgers have to go through multiple examination catalogues, and the stock life of certain foods should not exceed 40 days (Singla, 2012). In addition, there are strict standards that must be adhered while the products are being created. The products that do not meet the appropriate criteria are eliminated before being delivered to customers.
