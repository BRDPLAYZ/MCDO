Our Food
McDonalds serves the world some of its favorite food like the Big Mac, Big n' Tasty, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Cheeseburger, French Fries, Egg McMuffin, Apple Pie and Sundae. This is what we are famous for, globally and locally.

In the Philippines, we are also happy to serve local favorites like Chicken McDo, Burger McDo and McSpaghetti.  These favorites were specially made to cater to the unique Filipino palate.</p>

24/7 Restaurant and Delivery Service
It was in 2005 when McDonalds first introduced its 24-hour restaurants and all-day McDelivery service to the industry. At any time, customers can dial 86-2-36 or log-on to mcdelivery.com.ph to get their McDonalds favorites. And then in 2014, McDonald's expanded its McDelivery service to mobile through the McDo PH App, downloadable FREE at the App Store and Google Play Store.
